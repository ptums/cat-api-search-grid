Problem
Well, we got all these cats. Build a simple frontend application that allows users to view 20
different breeds of cats from https://docs.thecatapi.com/example-by-breed and displays them in
a user friendly format. ✅

Requirements
- Please utilize Next.js and Tailwind CSS to build the frontend. Any additional tools
needed are at your discretion.✅

- Cats should be displayed in a mobile responsive grid with an example image of the
breed, the name of the breed, their affection level, and a description of the breed. ✅

## User Stories

look at them ✅

- As a user, I want to be able to search for different breeds of cats so that I can see what
they look like ✅
